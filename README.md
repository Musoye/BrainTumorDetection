## Perequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Training

This is Notebook that's used to train this model [here](https://github.com/Musoye/BrainTumorDetection/blob/main/brain_tumor_tr.ipynb)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/musoye/brain_tumor_training.git
    cd brain_tumor_training
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e0B0UEv8DfSG735_M6dOKlIbAUCLsf_k/view?usp=sharing) and place it at the root directory.

5. Run this web app. and test it ```sh python3 app.py```

## Dataset

This model is trained based on this mri scans data available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection/data)
